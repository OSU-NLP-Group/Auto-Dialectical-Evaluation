This would be a contradiction, as it would mean both Helene and Vina cannot be right at the same time. \nTherefore, Ka cannot be telling the truth and must be lying. \n\nSo the answer is no.", "We can solve this by using a method called \"truth table\" where we simply list all possible truth values of the statements and their consequences. \n\nLet's label each statement as follows:\n\n- V: \"Vina tells the truth.\"\n- H: \"Helene says Vina lies.\"\n- K: \"Kandi says Helene tells the truth.\"\n- J: \"Jamey says Kandi lies.\"\n- A: \"Ka says Jamey lies.\"\n\nNow we can construct the truth table:\n\n| Statements | Truth Value |\n|------------|-------------|\n| V          | true        |\n| H          | false       |\n| K          | true        |\n| J          | false       |\n| A          | false       |\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Ka says Jamey lies, which means Ka is contradicting Jamey's statement, and therefore is saying the opposite of what Jamey says.

So M is telling the truth. \n\nD says M lies. This could be true or false, as we have no knowledge about whether M actually lies or not based on the given information. \n\nS says D tells the truth.

If Michael lies (contrary to his statement about Vernell), then Dallas tells the truth when he says that Michael lies. On the other hand, if Michael tells the truth, then Dallas lies when he says that Michael lies. Either way, we can't be sure whether Dallas tells the truth or lies. However, Shalonda says that Dallas tells the truth, so if we assume that Shalonda tells the truth, then Dallas must indeed tell the truth.
