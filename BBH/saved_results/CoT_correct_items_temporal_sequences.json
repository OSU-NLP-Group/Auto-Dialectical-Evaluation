Additionally, since Samantha was seen on the rooftop from 2pm to 3pm, we know that she could not have gone to the bakery during that time either. Therefore, the only remaining option is (D) 3pm to 9pm.

This means that David had two hours (between 6am to 8am) to go to the clothing store before Sarah spotted him. \n\nSimilarly, we see that David was at the theater between 9am to 11am according to Leslie, and was at the garden between 1pm to 3pm according to Hannah. Therefore, David had no chance to visit the store during these specific times.\n\nEmily saw David buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 1pm, which is the time frame in which David could have possibly gone to the clothing store before visiting the mall. However, we cannot be certain that he actually went to the store during this two-hour window. \n\nLastly, Samantha saw David reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm, which is after the clothing store had closed. \n\nGiven this information, the possible time frame for David to have gone to the clothing store was between 6am and 8am. Therefore, the answer is (C) 6am to 8am.", "The time range for when David went to the clothing store can be determined by looking at the timing of when all the other people saw him throughout the day. From the given information, it can be understood that David could not have gone to the clothing store during the time when Leslie saw him (9am to 11am), Hannah saw him (1pm to 3pm), and Samantha saw him (3pm to 4pm) because he was occupied with other activities at those times. Sarah saw him walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8am to 9am, which means it's possible that David could have gone to the store prior to this time at any point from 6am to 8am. Similarly, Emily sighted him shopping at the mall from 11am to 1pm, indicating that he could not have gone to the store during this time. This leaves us with the time slot of 8am to 9am as the only possible time that could correspond to when David went to the store. Therefore, the answer is (B) 8am to 9am.", "To determine between what times David could have gone to the clothing store, we need to identify a time when none of the other sightings took place. David woke up at 6am and the clothing store closed after 4pm so we can eliminate options (C) and (D). Sarah saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8am to 9am, Leslie saw him watching a movie at the theater from 9am to 11am, Emily saw him buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 1pm, Hannah saw him walking in the garden from 1pm to 3pm, and Samantha saw him reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm. \n\nTherefore, David could have gone to the clothing store between 6am to 8am, before Sarah saw him, or from 4pm to closing, after Samantha saw him. \n\nSo, the answer is (C) 6am to 8am or after 4pm until closing.", "David woke up at 6am and the clothing store was closed after 4pm. So, we cannot consider the time before 6am and after 4pm.\nSarah saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8am to 9am and Leslie saw David watching a movie at the theater from 9am to 11am. It means that David must have been at these places between 8 am and 11 am.\nEmily saw David buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 1pm. It implies that David could have been at the clothing store between 11 am and 1 pm.\nHannah saw David walking in the garden from 1pm to 3pm and Samantha saw David reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm. So David could not have gone to the clothing store after 1 pm because then he would have been in the garden or at the library.\n\nTherefore, the possible time David could have gone to the clothing store is between 11am and 1pm. So the answer is (A) 11am to 1pm.", "To determine between what times David could have gone to the clothing store, we should look for any gaps in the timeline where David was not seen by anyone. Based on the provided information, we see that there is a gap between 4pm and 6am the next day, during which time David was not seen by anyone. Therefore, David could have gone to the clothing store between 4pm and 6am the next day, which is outside the given options. \n\nSo the correct answer is NONE OF THE ABOVE.", "The clothing store was closed after 4pm, so we can eliminate any times after that. David woke up at 6am, and the earliest sighting of him was by Sarah at 8am. This means that he could have gone to the clothing store between 6am and 8am. Leslie saw him at the theater from 9am to 11am, which means that he could not have gone to the clothing store during that time. Emily saw him buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 1pm, so it is possible that he went to the clothing store during this time. However, Hannah saw him walking in the garden from 1pm to 3pm, which means that he could not have gone to the clothing store during that time either. And Samantha saw him reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm, which is after the store closed.\n\nSo the answer is (C) 6am to 8am or (A) 11am to 1pm.", "To determine the times that David could have gone to the clothing store, we need to identify the time period during which he wasn't seen by anyone.\n\nBased on the given information:\n- David woke up at 6am.\n- Sarah saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 8am to 9am.\n- Leslie saw David watching a movie at the theater from 9am to 11am.\n- Emily saw David buying clothes at the mall from 11am to 1pm.\n- Hannah saw David walking in the garden from 1pm to 3pm.\n- Samantha saw David reading at the library from 3pm to 4pm.\n\nWe can see that David was not seen by anyone between 6am to 8am.

John was seen sitting on a rooftop from 5am to 8am and watching a movie from 8am to 11am. Therefore, he could not have gone to the coffee shop until after 11am. Additionally, we know that John was seen at a yoga studio from 4pm to 5pm and buying a phone from 5pm to 7pm. Therefore, John could have gone to the coffee shop between 11am and 4pm.

This means that John could have left the rooftop at 8am, at the earliest. Sean saw John watching a movie at the theater from 8am to 11am, so John must have arrived at the coffee shop after 11am.\n\nTherefore, the only option remaining is option B (8am to 11am), between which John could have gone to the coffee shop. \n\nSo the answer is (B) 8am to 11am.", "Based on the given information, we can eliminate option C, since John was at the yoga studio during that time and he cannot be in two places at once. Following the same logic, we can also eliminate option D, since John was seen buying a phone at the electronics store during that time. The only two time slots that John could have gone to the coffee shop are between 5am-8am and 8am-11am. Therefore, John could have gone to the coffee shop either before or after David saw him sitting on the rooftop, or after Sean saw him watching a movie.
