Conserving energy: This can be done by using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and reducing water usage.\n\n3. Planting trees: Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so planting more trees can help reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.\n\n4. Supporting policies and regulations: Governments can implement policies and regulations that encourage businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n5. Educating others: Raising awareness about climate change and its impact on the environment can encourage individuals to take action and make changes in their daily lives.\n\nThese are just a few examples of ways to combat climate change.

This is a well-known concept in physics known as the \"equivalence principle.\" It states that the acceleration due to gravity experienced by an object is independent of its mass and composition. Therefore, both the lead and feather would fall at the same rate and reach the ground at the same time if they were dropped from the same height in a vacuum.

In a vacuum, the lead and the feather will fall at the same rate and neither of them will reach the bottom earlier because there is zero air resistance to slow them down.
