Free market capitalism is characterized by the absence of central planning and government intervention in the economy, while socialism typically involves significant government control and planning of the economy.

In a free market capitalist system, the market, through the forces of supply and demand, makes these decisions.", "No, that statement is not correct. A planned economy is not typically used in free market capitalism or socialism. Free market capitalism relies on a market system where the production and distribution of goods and services are determined by supply and demand, rather than by central planning. In contrast, socialism aims to create a more equal distribution of wealth and resources by placing ownership and control of the means of production in the hands of the community, either directly or through the government. In socialist economies, production and distribution may be planned to some extent, but this is not always the case.", "No, that statement is not correct. A planned economy and free market capitalism are opposite economic systems. Planned economy is a system where the government or a central authority plans and controls the production, distribution, and prices of goods and services, while free market capitalism is based on the principles of supply and demand, where the market determines the production, distribution, and prices of goods and services. Socialism, on the other hand, leans more towards a planned economy system.", "No, that statement is not correct. A planned economy is associated with socialism or command economies, not free market capitalism. In a planned economy, the government controls the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services according to a central plan. In contrast, free market capitalism allows the market to determine production, distribution, and pricing based on supply and demand without government intervention."]}, {"ex_id": "dev_1360", "sentence": "Badminton requires use of a racket to play.", "explanation": "Badminton involves using a racket to volley a rubber birdie.", "label": "true", "entity": "Badminton", "en_wiki_pageid": "3956", "entity_mention_loc": [[0, 9]], "question": "Badminton requires use of a racket to play?", "answer": "yes", "prediction_CoT_turbo": "Yes, badminton requires the use of a racket to play.
