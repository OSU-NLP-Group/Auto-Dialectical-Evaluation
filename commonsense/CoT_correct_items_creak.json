Free market capitalism is characterized by a decentralized economic system where individuals and businesses make their own decisions about what to produce, how to produce it, and at what price to sell it.

The statement \"You can see that a planned economy is used in free market capitalism not socialism\" is not true. Free market capitalism is characterized by private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and the market forces of supply and demand determine the prices and quantities of goods and services produced and consumed. On the other hand, a planned economy is characterized by government ownership or control of the means of production and distribution, and the government decides what goods and services are produced and how they are distributed. \n\nTherefore, it is not possible for a planned economy to be used in free market capitalism.
